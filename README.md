# Planetary Simulation
by: Lachi Balabanski

## Background:
This repository is a simulation of a planet and its gravity relative to a star. The orbits are not accurate to real life orbits, they are perfectly circluar, rather than eliptical.

## Use:
To properly execute the file, use:

```bash
$ python main.py [-s, --show]
```

#### Parameter:
-s, --show: toggle display of the acceleration, force of gravity, etc. (give as boolean)

When using the "Exit to Desktop" button while the planet is still being modeled, wait for the planet to return to the start position. Wait a little longer for the program to finish, this may take a couple of seconds. To avoid errors, do not press the exit button at the top corner of the window.
